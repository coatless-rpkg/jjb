The goal of `bmisc` is to provide tools frequently used in analyses. As a 
result, the package contains a large amount of functions I use in day to day
analyses.

### Installation

The `bmisc` package is available on both CRAN and GitHub. The CRAN version is
considered stable while the GitHub version is in a state of development and 
may break. 

You can install the stable version of the `bmisc` package with:

```r
install.packages("bmisc")
```

For those who like living on the edge, feel free to use a copy of the 
development version by doing:

```r
# Install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# Install the package from github
devtools::install_github("coatless/bmisc")
```

### Usage

```r
library("bmisc")
```
