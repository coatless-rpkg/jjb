# Utilities

The package hosts various utilities to improve working with simulated data.

In particular, the package offers the ability to cast a simulation `matrix` to
`data.frame` for graphing within `ggplot2`. The simulation cast feature is
meant to ease the use of simulated data within `ggplot2`. Thus, support exists
for both casting simulated data stored by row (default) and by column into a
`Round` and `Draw` framework, where `Round` means the simulation iteration and
`Draw` means the statistic observed.

```{r simulation_objects}
# Set Seed
set.seed(5812)

# Generate data
m = matrix(rnorm(10), 2, 5)

# Organize by row
wide_m = sim_df(m)

# View first 5 rows
head(wide_m, n = 5)

# Organize by column
long_m = sim_df(m, wide = FALSE)

# View first 5 rows
head(long_m, n = 5)

# Graph wide
autoplot(wide_m)

# Graph long
autoplot(long_m)
```
