# `bmisc` R Package

The goal of `bmisc` is to provide tools frequently used in analyses. As a 
result, the package contains a large amount of functions I use in day to day
analyses.

# Install Instructions (All platforms)

To install the `bmisc` package, there are two options: CRAN (stable) or GitHub (Developmental)

The installation process with CRAN is the simplest

```r
install.packages("bmisc")
```

For those who like living on the edge, feel free to use a copy of the 
development version by doing:

```r
# Install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# Install the package from github
devtools::install_github("coatless/bmisc")
```

# Licensing

GPL-3

Please retain the attributions behind the functions listed.
